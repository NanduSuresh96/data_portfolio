# Nandu Narayan Suresh | Data Portfolio 📊

Hi!, lets start with an introduction. I am currently a Master's student specializing in **Business Intelligence** and **Data Analytics** who has prior experience working with data in a local scale in India looking to go global within an International organization in **Europe**. I love to work with data and am currently diving into the world of **Machine Learning** and **AI** by taking an online Machine Learning certification from **Stanford Online**. With a newfound passion for creating ML models and an already ignited passion for converting **Data** into **Insights/Strategy** or creating **pipelines** for seamless dataflow, I am seeking my next adventure with data in **Analysis, Engineering or ML**. This repo will be updated with new projects as they come. Hope you like what you see and reach out if you do!


Now, **Welcome to my portfolio.** This repository presents the **results and visual outputs** of projects I have recently taken up like **Dashboards, Reports, etc.**. You will find standalone repositories containing codebases, files and detailed descriptions for each of these projects and if you don't, you can bet on seeing them soon as I will be uploading them after some structuring and refining.

## 🌍 Project 1: Climate Risk & Carbon Exposure - A case study based on a theoretical Energy company in France
*Targeting: Parametric Insurance & Underwriting*

This study evaluates physical and transition risks for a theoretical French energy provider using satellite and regulatory datasets. All assumptions are made based on data available at the time of analysis.

- **Objective:** Quantify financial exposure to carbon pricing and flood perils.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (Xarray, Pandas), NetCDF (Copernicus Satellite Data), Excel, EDGAR Emission Database, World Bank Database.
- **Key Insight:** Identified a 12-18% EBITDA margin risk due to unmanaged climate factors.

## 📈 Project 2: Conceptual Quantitative Equity Forecasting Engine
*Targeting: Portfolio Management & Investment Analysis*

An ensemble machine learning pipeline designed to forecast stock returns and project long-term ROI across 7 major tech-stocks including MSTR, a highly volatile and crypto dependent stock.

**Disclaimer**: This project is **experimental and analytical in nature**, not a trading system or investment recommendation. Model evaluation emphasized **temporal consistency**, not peak metrics. 

- **Objective:** Predict tech-sector returns using macro and historical data using tree based and classical time series modeling.
- **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, statsmodels, XGBoost, SARIMA, etc.), SQL, Microstrategy.
- **Key Insight:** As visualized in the ensemble forecast dashboard, MSTR shows wider outcome dispersion than NVIDIA under the SARIMA–XGBoost model, emphasizing regime sensitivity and amplified uncertainty.
